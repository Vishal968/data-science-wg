# Crime Data Analysis Of New York City
This project is a part of the [Data Science Working Group](http://datascience.codeforsanfrancisco.org) at [Code for San Francisco](http://www.codeforsanfrancisco.org).  Other DSWG projects can be found at the [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/sfbrigade/data-science-wg).

#### -- Project Status: Active

## Project Intro/Objective
The fundamental goal of our project is to build a model that canpredict the crime based on different categories such as the location,the time of occurrence, the level of crime.  The predictive analysis helps in predictingthe level of crime that is the type of crime that can be predictedon a given location at a certain time.

## Project Description
*The NYPD has made all the crime data available from the year 2006to 2021 (current year) for public interest. The motivation behind taking up this topic for the project is tomake the society threat safe. We will use big data analytics on the given historic data and analyze the patterns and trends in crimeover the years. The predicted results might not be 100% accuratebut they will surely help to reduce crime rates to some extent in NYC.
## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
